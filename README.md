# Intro
## Tauri + Vanilla TS

In order to just care about the state part and avoid other complications I decided to use the vanilla TS (maybe I've should picked JS) template.
To make things even easier I kept most of the default during the project creation part. So:
- The GUI visuals can be found [here](./index.html).
- The GUI logic can be found [here](./src/main.ts)
- The rust related logic can be found [here](./src-tauri/main.rs).

## Recommended IDE Setup

This one is my preferred choice.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)

This recommendation was generated by the creation tool.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
